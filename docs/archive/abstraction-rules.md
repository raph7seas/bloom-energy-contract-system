EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY (Sequencing)
Step 1: Initial Document Review
1.	Scan the entire document to understand overall structure
2.	Identify key sections: parties, recitals, definitions, commercial terms
3.	Note any exhibits, schedules, or appendices with relevant information
4.	Create a mental map of where different types of information appear
Step 2: Systematic Information Gathering
1.	Start with Parties Section: Extract all entity names and roles
2.	Review Definitions: Understand how key terms are defined
3.	Commercial Terms: Focus on pricing, capacity, and delivery terms
4.	Technical Specifications: Extract energy parameters and performance metrics
5.	Financial Provisions: Identify payment terms and guarantees
Step 3: Cross-Reference and Validate
1.	Check that all extracted information is consistent throughout the document
2.	Verify that defined terms are used correctly
3.	Ensure units are properly converted and standardized
4.	Confirm that all parties mentioned in the body appear in the parties section
Step 4: Quality Control Checks
Completeness Verification:
•	Have all primary parties been identified?
•	Are energy parameters complete (capacity, volume, duration)?
•	Is pricing information comprehensive (base price, escalation, limits)?
•	Are delivery specifications clear?
Accuracy Validation:
•	Do numbers make sense in context (e.g., reasonable $/MWh pricing)?
•	Are units consistent throughout?
•	Do contract dates align logically?
•	Are party relationships clearly understood?
Consistency Review:
•	Do all sections of the contract align with extracted information?
•	Are there any conflicting terms or conditions?
•	Do exhibits and schedules match main contract terms?
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Complex Ownership Structures

3.	Missing Escalations: Look carefully for pricing adjustments over time
4.	Overlooking Exhibits: Key information often appears in schedules and appendices
5.	Ignoring Definitions: Defined terms may have specific meanings different from common usage
